#+TITLE: Notes ******** How I #Think authentication with the web socket will happen

** Route the user to either #StudentLogin or #TeacherLogin
*** with the user routed use the authentication method on that port with the encyption key
**** After User has been authenticated the port #SHOULD be open to connect to from the stomp socket
**** Since the only ports i left to be open were the #Login ports
***** Once this is done the system can track user session in socket along with the users that have signed in
***** this method would make sure there is no un need taxation on the server from users spamming the server
